**GALAXY**

For the second sketch, I decided to use simple shapes to make an interesting animation. After playing around with different shapes, starting with squares, then rectangles, then ellipses and then finally, I decided to stick to spheres. Using spheres for animation gives it the 3d effect and all the curve lines of spheres intersecting with each other make for a cool pattern. Additionally, I chose a dark background and contrasting colors while still being part of a pallete to make it visually interesting. The colors, the shapes and the intersection patterns are an inspiration from stars and forces in a galaxy. The app in action has very hypnotizing/ dizzing effect so I played around with the frame rate to be slow enough to figure out the workflow but still fast enough to be interesting.

The workflow of the sketch is pretty simple actually. The complex patterns created on screen does give the illusion of a lengthy code, but it is surprisingly simple. I believe sometimes simpler is better. I initialized global variables that controlled the dimensions of the spheres and variables to control the changes and extent of growth and looping of the motion. To set the attention to the center of the screen, I translated the points to the center of the screen and then rotate the sphere around that axis in anticlockwise and clockwise motion looping into each other. I drew five spheres of different initial radius and that makes the illusion of spheres inside each other.
