The start of this first assignment had me clueless and scratching my head figuring out a way to present something aesthetic while considering the technicalities. I started my prcoess by first creating a dynamic shape made of lines. Although I intended it to start building on its own from the very first frame but I was unable to achieve it and only one line draw at a point dynamically moving about a point. Therefore, I switched the code to store points for each line in the shape. To setup, I created a nested array of size 20 shapes x 1000 lines per shape. The arrays _xloc1_, _yloc1_, _xloc2_ and _yloc2_ store point locations for all lines. Additionally, _opacity_ is a nested array too that contains opacity of each line in every shape. For the start, I initalize all the arrays to maximum but as the user controls the variables _No# shapes_ and _No# lines per shape_ through the GUI, the shapes are drawn dynamically.
