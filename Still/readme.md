**Bloom Flowers**

The start of this first assignment had me clueless and scratching my head to figure out a way to present something aesthetic while considering the technicalities. I started my process by first creating a dynamic shape made of lines. Although I intended to start building on its own from the very first frame, I was unable to achieve it and only one line draw at a point dynamically moving about a point. Therefore, I switched the code to store points for each line in the shape. To set up in the start, I created a nested array of size 20 shapes x 1000 lines per shape. The arrays _xloc1_, _yloc1_, _xloc2_ and _yloc2_ store point locations for all lines. Additionally, _opacity_ is a nested array too that contains the opacity of each line in every shape. For the start, I initialized all the arrays to maximum but as the user controls the variables _No# shapes_ and _No# lines per shape_ through the GUI, the shapes are drawn dynamically.

In alignment with the aesthetics of the app, I decided to allow users to choose colors out of five palettes. The color palettes are inspired by the available examples on color-hex.com. The desired RGB values are obtained from the same site. Initially, I set the background color to be white but in the end switched to a black base as I believe the colors and the different opacities of the lines really stand out and make for a pleasing visual experience. To satisfy most of the visual expectations, I have tried to include different color palettes including pastels, contrasts, bright colours etc. 

Check out these different stills from the app:

Reflecting back on the creative process, it was much rather unexpected than intended. I knew I wanted to have minimal shapes and greater flexibility but was not sure how to implement it. Trying out different practice examples from openFrameworks tutorials eventually led me to something unintended and I am actually proud of it. The many definite values in the code such as updating noise values for radius and angle are some numbers obtained by playing around with the sketch and sticking to the values that felt just right. For sure there would be values that would give unexpected and amazing results and it will be definitely worth spending time on. However, after playing around and obsessing over the visuals for a day, I realized it is time to stick to particular values. This explains the definite numbers in the code. Actually, no explanation, just seemed pretty nice.
